Hey Guys I thought I would look into a better way to develop this project so here are the steps for how we are going to work on this project moving forward:


1. Create Branch
2. Make Changes
3. Write Commit Message
4. Commit your changes
5. Push your changes to your branch in github
6. When finished making all changes: Create a pull Request
7. Address Review Comments
8. Merge your pull request
9. Delete your branch
10. Repeat the process

For an Example: (This is technically step 1: Step by step)
1. I say I am working on the blog page 
2. I would then go create a new branch called "BlogWork" on github
3. I would then use the newMainBranch as the source (So that I get up to date code)
4. I would then go to the new branch in github and press <>Code -> Clone Via URL -> Copy the URL 
5. Open VSCODE and go the the Commande Palette (first option under View)
6. Type "gitcl" in the search and press Git: Clone
7. You will then be prompted with another search bar where you will now paste that URL you copied from github 
8. You may now be prompted to sign in to github (this is normal)
9. You will then be prompted to select the local directory for which you want to store the repository you just cloned on your own computer (I.e desktop etc)
10. Then a window will ask if you would like to open the repository in which you will say ok and it will open

DONE you are now able to begin coding and and start at step 2 (make chagnes) and repeat as needed.
